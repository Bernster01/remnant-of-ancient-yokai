# The World
**

The campaign is set in the lands known as Aimaiyo (曖昧 世) a mysterious land tucked away. All sorts of creatures call Aimaiyo their home. Here two worlds exist side by side, the material and spirit realm. The border separating the material and spirit realms is thin, allowing spirits, yokai, and other supernatural entities to traverse freely between them. This permeable boundary gives rise to a harmonious yet precarious balance, where the living and the spiritual share the same space.

In Aimaiyo, spirits are not distant entities but integral parts of the landscape. Villages are often built with spiritual considerations, and every river, stone, and gust of wind has a spirit associated with it. The land itself breathes with spiritual energy, influencing the flora, fauna, and even the weather. 

The yokai in aimaiyo are diverse in their appearance and behaviors. Some are human-like, while others are monstrous, animalistic, or entirely abstract in form. Their origins are as varied as their forms: some are born from the lingering emotions of the deceased, others are nature spirits linked to specific landscapes, and a few are ancient beings from before man emerged. Yokai are spirits in physical form. Some yokai can be classified as mere beasts while some are more intelligent than humans.

There exist four Guardian Yokai, ancient and powerful spirits appointed by the ancient powers to maintain the equilibrium between the worlds. These ancient spirits, each aligned with a cardinal direction, have watched over the land for eons, ensuring that the balance between the worlds is maintained.

For the last century a dark aura has befallen the guardians. The people’s concern is growing that the once mighty guardians may soon be too weak to protect the lands. The cause of this predicament is unknown. At the same time, the yokai that once coexisted with man, have started behaving strangely. Some yokai have become malevolent and are attacking the rural villages dotted around the world. Faced with the uncertainty the yokai living in villages and cities have become outcasts and shunned by the possibility of them going feral. This phenomena was dubbed the Yami-no-Tenkan (闇の転換) the phenomena of yokai turning dark and evil. While the yokai started turning feral the other inhabitants found some hope when they were blessed with an unknown force, dubbed karma. It is not known how or why the people were blessed with karma. In light of the fear of the yokai and the sudden blessing of karma, a man known as Aka-ji (赤じ) who formed the Yokai Hunting Guild emerged vowing to protect the villages and find the root cause of the Yami-no-Tenkan (闇の転換) and karma. 

The Yokai Hunter Guild, founded by [[Aka-ji]] (赤じ), has sworn to protect every village from the malevolent yokai and to find the causes of the behavior. Headquartered in the neutral city of Hanran (半乱), the Yokai Hunter Guild serves as a beacon of hope in Aimaiyo. Comprising hunters, scholars, and spiritualists, the guild investigates disturbances in the spiritual ecosystem, eradicates the malevolent yokai, and seeks to understand the forces threatening Aimaiyo's harmony. Hunters often receive blessings from shrines they visit to aid them in the hunting. 

Aimaiyo is dotted with sacred shrines and ritualistic sites, where villagers pay homage to the spirits. Powerful beings, known as Kami, inhabit these sacred places, guiding and influencing the land's destiny. The rituals performed at these shrines are crucial for maintaining the spiritual balance.
